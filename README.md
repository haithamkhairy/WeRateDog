# WeRateDog
This report is about Twitter account WeRateDogs that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. I gathered information from many sources as Twitter API, csv files, and tsv files to analysis data using Python and its libraries about the dogs’ breeds and dogs’ stage, and the interactions with dogs’ ratings, retweets count and favorites count.
